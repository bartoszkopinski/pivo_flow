PivoFlow lets you choose the story you are currently working on from Pivotal Tracker. Intended for all the people, who doesn't like feature-branch approach or are "merd≈ºuj - nie pier*ol"-theory enthusiasts.

## Installation

Install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pivo_flow

## Usage

All the required information is gathered on demand, but it's a good idea to prepare:

* project's Pivotal Tracker ID
* your Pivotal Tracker API token (see here https://www.pivotaltracker.com/profile#api)
  * when project's ID is strictly connected with one project, API-token is for all the projects, so the best solution would be to add it globally to git config:

  `git config --global pivo-flow.pivotal-token YOUR_PIVOTAL_API_TOKEN`

## Git-hooks

This gem installs a `pepare-commit-msg` hook by adding a reference to `pf-prepare-commit-msg` file. In short: you shouldn't be worried about your own `prepare-commit-msg` hook, the one added by `pivo_flow` will be added in the last line of original hook file.
