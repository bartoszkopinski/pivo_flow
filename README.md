# PivoFlow

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lubieniebieski/pivo_flow.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/lubieniebieski/pivo_flow)

PivoFlow let's you choose the story from Pivotal Tracker you are currently working on. Intended for all the people, who doesn't like feature-branch approach or are "merd≈ºuj - nie pier*ol"-theory enthusiasts.

## Installation

Install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pivo_flow

## Usage

All the required information is gathered on demand, but it's a good idea to prepare:

* project's Pivotal Tracker ID
* your Pivotal Tracker API token

Show help

    pf help

or

    pf --help

Get list of current stories with an interactive choice menu

    pf stories

Start story with given ID

    pf start STORY_ID

Finish current story [or given story ID]

    pf finish [STORY_ID]

Clear current story without notifying Pivotal

    pf clear

Show finished stories and select the one you would like to deliver

    pf deliver

Display current gem version

    pf version

Show current STORY_ID from temp file

    pf current

## Git-hooks

This gem installs a `pepare-commit-msg` hook by adding a reference to `pf-prepare-commit-msg` file. In short: you shouldn't be worried about your own `prepare-commit-msg` hook, the one added by `pivo_flow` will be added in the last line of original hook file.
